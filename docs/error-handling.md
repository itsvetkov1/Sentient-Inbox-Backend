# Error Handling and Reliability Specifications

## Introduction
The error handling and reliability system ensures robust operation of the email management system through comprehensive error detection, graceful failure handling, and detailed logging mechanisms. This specification outlines the complete approach to maintaining system stability and reliability throughout all processing stages.

## Retry Mechanism

### Core Retry Strategy
The system implements a carefully designed retry mechanism for handling transient failures. When an error occurs during processing, the system follows these precise steps:
1. Immediate error detection and logging
2. Implementation of a 3-second delay before retry attempt
3. Single retry execution
4. Final status determination

### Retry Limitations
The system implements specific limitations on retry attempts to prevent resource waste and endless processing loops. These limitations include:
- No retry attempts for content parsing failures
- Single retry limit for all other failures
- Strict 3-second delay enforcement between attempts
- Automatic failure reporting after retry exhaustion

### Error Categories and Handling
The system distinguishes between different types of errors for appropriate handling:
- Processing Errors: Eligible for retry with delay
- Parsing Errors: No retry, immediate failure reporting
- System Errors: Eligible for retry with delay
- Network Errors: Eligible for retry with delay

## Logging Requirements
