# Sentient Inbox API Integration Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of integrating frontend applications with the Sentient Inbox Backend API. For more detailed information, please refer to the specific documentation files listed below.

## Documentation Resources

- [API Documentation](./api_documentation.md) - Comprehensive reference for all API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and error handling.
- [Frontend Integration Guide](./frontend_integration_guide.md) - Practical guide with implementation examples for frontend developers.

## API Architecture

The Sentient Inbox Backend API follows RESTful principles and is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Authentication** - User authentication via username/password and OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft)
2. **Email Processing** - Endpoints for retrieving, analyzing, and managing emails
3. **Dashboard** - Endpoints for retrieving analytics and statistics for the dashboard UI

## Authentication Flow

The API supports two authentication methods:

1. **Password-based Authentication** - Standard username/password authentication
2. **OAuth Authentication** - Integration with Google and Microsoft accounts

Both methods result in a JWT token that must be included in subsequent API requests in the `Authorization` header.

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Authentication Integration

Frontend applications should implement:
- Login forms for password authentication
- OAuth login buttons for supported providers
- Token storage and management
- Permission-based access control

### 2. Email Management

Frontend applications should implement:
- Email listing with pagination and filtering
- Email detail views
- Email analysis capabilities
- Settings management

### 3. Dashboard Integration

Frontend applications should implement:
- Display of key metrics and statistics
- Data visualization components
- Period-based filtering
- User activity tracking

## Getting Started

1. Review the [API Documentation](./api_documentation.md) to understand available endpoints
2. Follow the [Frontend Integration Guide](./frontend_integration_guide.md) for practical implementation examples
3. Set up authentication in your frontend application
4. Implement the necessary UI components for email management and dashboard visualization

## Security Considerations

- Store authentication tokens securely (preferably in memory, not localStorage for production)
- Implement proper permission checks in UI
- Handle token expiration gracefully
- Never expose sensitive API endpoints to unauthorized users
- Implement proper error handling for security-related errors

## Performance Best Practices

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement debouncing for search operations
- Optimize dashboard data retrieval
- Monitor and handle rate limiting appropriately
