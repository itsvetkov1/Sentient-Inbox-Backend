# Email Management System

## Project Overview
An advanced automated email management system with RESTful API endpoints for meeting coordination through Gmail integration. The system employs a sophisticated AI-powered architecture using FastAPI and Groq, with specialized components designed for efficient email processing and response handling. The foundation includes secure storage encryption, API integration capabilities, and Gmail integration with OAuth2 authentication.

## Core Architecture

### API Layer
1. FastAPI Framework
   - RESTful endpoint definitions
   - Async request handling
   - Pydantic model validation
   - CORS middleware
   - Health monitoring

### Content Processing System
1. HTML Content Processing
   - BeautifulSoup-based HTML cleaning
   - Content structure preservation
   - Pattern recognition and preservation
   - Token limit management

2. Date Processing System
   - RFC 2822 and ISO 8601 support
   - Multiple format recognition
   - Timezone handling
   - Fallback strategies

3. Three-Stage Email Analysis Pipeline
   a. Initial Meeting Classification (Llama Model)
      - Content chunking and preprocessing
      - Binary classification of emails
      - Processing of new, unhandled emails
      - Weekly rolling history maintenance

   b. Detailed Content Analysis (Deepseek R1 Model)
      - Pattern-aware content analysis
      - Date extraction and validation
      - Meeting parameter extraction
      - Complexity assessment
      - Missing information detection

   c. Final Decision Making (Llama Model)
      - Analysis consolidation
      - Confidence evaluation
      - Pattern verification
      - Final categorization

### Processing Rules
- API request validation
- Content preprocessing before analysis
- Pattern preservation during processing
- Required meeting details validation
- Date format standardization
- Token limit enforcement
- Batch processing optimization
- Error handling with retries

## Technical Requirements
- FastAPI for REST API framework
- Uvicorn for ASGI server
- BeautifulSoup for HTML processing
- RFC 2822 and ISO 8601 date handling
- Groq API integration for AI processing
