## In Progress

### Core Functionality
- Fine-tuning of Llama model for initial classification and final decision making
- Optimization of Deepseek R1 model for detailed content analysis
- Response quality improvement based on three-stage analysis
- Performance optimization of the analysis pipeline
- Implementation of agent coordination system

### Testing
- Develop comprehensive unit tests for each stage of the analysis pipeline
- Create integration tests to verify end-to-end email processing
- Implement stress tests to ensure system stability under high load
- Validate logging and error reporting functionality across all components

### Documentation
- API documentation for the three-stage analysis pipeline
- Usage guidelines for the new system architecture
- Error handling documentation for the enhanced retry mechanism
- Setup instructions for Groq and Deepseek API integrations

## Pending Items

### System Enhancements
- Monitoring dashboard development
- Agent configuration interface creation
- Response template system enhancement
- Batch processing further optimization

### Monitoring
- Implementation of advanced metrics analysis for the three-stage pipeline
- Development of performance dashboards
- Error pattern detection across all stages
- Usage statistics for Groq and Deepseek APIs

### Security
- Regular security audit system implementation
- Enhanced access control for the three-stage pipeline
- Encryption key rotation mechanism
- Data integrity verification enhancement

## Known Issues
- Fine-tuning required for Llama model in both initial classification and final decision making
- Performance impact of the three-stage analysis pipeline on large email volumes needs assessment
- Potential API rate limiting issues with multiple API calls (Groq and Deepseek)
- Comprehensive testing needed for various email scenarios in the new pipeline
- Documentation updates required to reflect the new three-stage analysis system

## Next Steps
1. Debug the project to ensure correct operation of the three-stage pipeline
2. Implement the agent coordination system
3. Develop the monitoring dashboard
4. Create the agent configuration interface
5. Enhance the response template system

This progress tracking helps maintain focus on development priorities and outstanding tasks for the new three-stage email analysis system.
